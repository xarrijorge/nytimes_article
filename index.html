                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, 
                        an itinerant young physicist named Alan
                         Guth, with a new son and a year’s 
                         appointment at Stanford, stayed up late 
                         with his notebook and equations, venturing
                          far beyond the world of known physics.
                        He was trying to understand why there was 
                        no trace of some exotic particles that 
                        should have been created in the Big Bang. 
                        Instead he discovered what might have made
                        the universe bang to begin with. A potential
                        hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
                        evolution could have infused space itself
                         with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
                         causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
                         the page and drew a double box around it.

                                                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in.
                                                        Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
                                                        the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                                                         known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

                                                        cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
                                                         astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
                                                         for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called 
                                                         gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                                                         violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth 
                                                         of a trillionth of a second old. 
                                                         They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
                                                        Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                                                        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
                                                         including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.

                                                <p>
                                                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark
                                                         in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                                                         pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
                                                         It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to 
                                                         science and speculation.

                                                        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
                                                        extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
                                                         is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, 
                                                         architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
                                                        beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity,
                                                        like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                                In our own universe, it would serve as a 
                                window into the forces operating at energies 
                                forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
                                 on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                                  Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                                   observation of gravitational waves, which, 
                                   according to Einstein’s theory of general 
                                   relativity, should ruffle space-time.

                            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                             sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                        </p>
                        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath 
                            of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
                             of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.

                    <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
                    <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which 
                            explains how the universe expanded so uniformly 
                        and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                            <p>
                            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, 
                            which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. 
                            They won the Nobel Prize.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. 
                                He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of 
                                increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, 
                                dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, 
                                Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

                            In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
                            microwave radiation was polarized, 
                            meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                            This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the 
                            gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves,
                             squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
                             theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.

                     <p>
                            Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves.
                             The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

                     <p>
                            The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, 
                            and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, 
                            making sure they had things right and worrying 
                            that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.

                         The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, 
                         staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, 
                         suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.

                <p>
                        Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
                         gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
                          But they have long suspected that those are simply 
                        different manifestations of a single unified force that 
                        ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                </p>
                 <p>
                        As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace,
                         like some old folk mythology of
                         gods or brothers falling out with each other. 
                         The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
                </p>
                <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                <p>
                        Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
                         until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Similarly, the universe could “supercool” 
                        and stay in a unified state too long.
                         In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
                         and the universe would blow itself up. 
                        Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force,
                         the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                        What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
                         from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside,
                         relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. 
                         All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” 
                        Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”

                        Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from 
                        Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion,
                         the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
                          spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                        So the future of the cosmos is 
                        perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. 
                                All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, 
                                forever out of our view.

                                “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, 
                                a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of
                                 the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
