                <p>
                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, 
                        an itinerant young physicist named Alan
                         Guth, with a new son and a year’s 
                         appointment at Stanford, stayed up late 
                         with his notebook and equations, venturing
                          far beyond the world of known physics.
                        He was trying to understand why there was 
                        no trace of some exotic particles that 
                        should have been created in the Big Bang. 
                        Instead he discovered what might have made
                        the universe bang to begin with. A potential
                        hitch in the presumed course of cosmic 
                        evolution could have infused space itself
                         with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
                         causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. 
                        The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                        like spit in the ocean.
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
                         the page and drew a double box around it.

                    <p>
                            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in.
                            Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
                            the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                             known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of 
                            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
                             astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center 
                             for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called 
                             gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                             violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth 
                             of a trillionth of a second old. 
                             They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
                            Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
                             including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark
                             in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                             pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
                             It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to 
                             science and speculation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
                            extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
                             is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, 
                             architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
                            beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity,
                            like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

                                In our own universe, it would serve as a 
                                window into the forces operating at energies 
                                forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
                                 on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                                  Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                                   observation of gravitational waves, which, 
                                   according to Einstein’s theory of general 
                                   relativity, should ruffle space-time.
